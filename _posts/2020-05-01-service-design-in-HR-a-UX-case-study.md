Many leading organizations use Development Centers to get a grip of their talent pool and prepare their future executives. I have been in many development centers. If you have too (or are familiar with the process), I'm sure the following will not be completely unfamiliar:

- Participants complaining about how difficult it was to show their true selves during the exercises.
- borderline awkward opening sessions where tension reigns.
- De-energized participants, too overwhelmed to engage in coaching or development planning.
- Participants absolutely missing the point of an exercise.
- Feedback sessions gone awry due to high levels of defensiveness.

Part of the reason is that Development Centers were not originally devised to be gratifying experiences. They are the result of  a mechanistic approach to learning and development. The methodology behind Development Centers is directed  to serve the needs of the organization first, which has favoured robustness over friendliness. Combine measurement and standardization with highly formalistic, business-like organizational cultures and you have the recipe for creating a process that throws the needs of adult learners by the wayside. Development Centers in general do a great job at registering behavior and measuring competencies. However, research shows that participants' ability to digest feedback and progress in their careers will be strongly influenced by the layers of experience of these programs.

Practitioners, Talent Managers and HR departments can do better. I believe there is a massive opportunity to create development programs that serve the learning needs of future leaders first. Development Centers are artifacts that reflect a company's culture and its take on leadership. They are a safe space where an open conversation about what good leadership behavior looks like can take place. Development Centers should ignite incipient leaders to move their careers forward. And they should be designed for such purpose.

In this post, I explore in a case study how tools in Service Design can help in delivering better Development Centers. Entrepreneurs, technologists and designers have unlocked lots of value by designing their businesses around customers - I am sure there is value for HR and Organizational Development professionals in designing around the context of their learners too.

## What is a Development Center anyways?

Development centers are multi-day events where participants face various simulations while they are observed by a team of assessors. The purposes of a Development Center may vary, but they are generally connected to competency and skill measurement.

It's difficult to explain development centers without mentioning its close cousin,  the assessment center. Back in the 1940's, Germany devised assessment centers to  measure aptitude and fitness in military personnel. Today, HR departments worldwide use them for selecting candidates.  Assessment centers mix and match interviews, case studies, presentations, role plays, work samples and questionnaires to get a 360 view on the competencies and skills of a given candidate.

General Electric, Standard Oil and IBM were the early adopters, but the methodology did not really take off until a landmark article was published in the Harvard Business Review in 1970. This slowly led to the consecration of the organizational psychologist, and the rise of consulting companies like PDI and DDI.

Development Centers came as a natural spin-off in the 1980's. Using a very similar methodology, the focus is on auditing internal employees as opposed to external candidates. HR departments generally use development centers to map their talent pipeline, locate high potentials and set a development roadmap for employees who will take bigger roles in the future.

Nowadays it's difficult come by assessments that do not include any developmental components. Some firms use Assessment Center and Development Center interchangeably, while others prefer to save the first term for selection and the second for development. I will just use ACDC's from now on for brevity.

ACDC's can help solve important organizational problems for big companies. They enable a standardized approach to measuring capabilities via direct observation, and the methodology can be easily embedded into HR strategy at any level. Research has for the most part shown decent reliability and validity, but ACDC's still have a few trade-offs and pitfalls.

**ACDC's are process-heavy and expensive to run.** Setting up an ACDC involves arranging logistics for multiple participants, observers, organizers and facilitators for various days in an off-site location. In a multinational company, costs multiply quickly when you have to fly people from all over the world to the same location.

**Competency measurement alone does not provide all the answers.** Contrary to mainstream management beliefs, A-players do not always want to reach the top of the organization. Interestingly, people with higher competency profiles do not necessarily take their careers further. Research  shows that high career ambition (usually measured via structured interviews) is a better predictor for career advancement than  any other metric during a development center.

**There is a long lasting impact for people who don't do well.** While it is proven that ACDC's do a good job at measuring competencies in valid and reliable manner, the experience for participants is far from the best. A growing body of research shows that many candidates experience evaluation anxiety prior to entering exercises, and it can significantly affect their performance and subsequently their own self-efficacy. There is an evaluation aftermath that is not always well handled either. Unsuccessful participants in ACDCs show less organizational commitment and career drive. Rejected candidates suffer dips in their self-esteem and their motivation to achieve.

ACDCs were created by psychologists, and yet some basic aspects of human behavior and motivation are not a core part of their design.  This paradox is partially explained by their moment of birth:  The heyday of behaviourism and operationism, when psychology fought tooth and nail to be a 'hard' field like economics or engineering. Classic ACDC implementations take an utilitarian approach  -  Company and organizational goals are valued most. Assessment elements like simulations, competency models and observation tools are optimized, while learning and experiential elements are overlooked in favor of efficiency. ACDCs have put most of its efforts on achieving excellent structure, they have not considered the participants' well-being  while being observed and assessed.

> ACDCs have put most of it efforts on achieving excellent structure, they have not particularly cared about context - that is, the context that is experienced by the participant.

The International Task Force Assessement Center Guideline  is not a source of solace either. The guide asserts the right of candidates to receive feedback. There is no discussion about the psychological well-being other than general phrases about follow up and support.

It's almost 2020, ACDC's can do better than this. Better organizational outcomes and a more enriching experience for learners can be achieved.  Using tools that analyse the context and mindset of participants can help us give the best that behavioral science has to offer.

In the following sections, I go through a mock ACDC and use a number of tools borrowed from Human Centered Design to provide a better understanding of the context, the actors, and the different experiences that participants go through. After that , I leave some ideas and hypotheses with the intent of inspiring other practitioners.

## What is Service Design anyways ?

Service Design is the application of human-centered design methodologies to innovate or reinvent services. Service design gathers a variety of mindsets, processes and tools that respond to the following principles:

- Human-Centered  - Takes into account the worldview of all the different people affected by the delivery of a service.
- Co-creative - Relies on multidisciplinary teams to be actively engaged in the design of a service.
- Iterative - Service Design works towards a solution in small steps, securing stakeholder buy-in and learning continuously.
- Sequential - Services should be conceptualised in artifacts that represent a service a series of  interconnected steps and actions.
- Real - The nature of a service needs to be researched for real. Ideas should be prototyped for real.
- Holistic - The whole environment in which a service operates should be considered.

The value proposition of Service Design lies at its massive disagreement with management approaches care mostly about operational excellence and lagging KPI's. If we the most we care about is cost and efficiency, we will provide services that obey to mechanistic paradigm. Service Design offers the alternative to understand people and their needs deeply, which is where value really is.

Some design folks love to argue about the differences between all the 'Designs' ( Experience Design, Design Thinking, Customer Experience Design ). From my humble point of view as a non-designer, I believe it makes much more sense to look at the overlaps and keep the end goal in mind. The Service Design Mindset stresses the importance of learning from experience, iterating quickly on ideas, and have a positive impact on the people involved on a service.

Consistent with its philosophy, Service Design does not try to shoehorn a standardized design process to every given  problem. The discipline identifies a series of common steps such as Research, Ideation, Prototyping and Implementation. All steps rely on a core pattern of diverging and converging until an outcome is reached - This is known in  as the double diamond.

In some domains, process frameworks provide clear guidance on 'things should happen'. In Service Design, process frameworks are there to give practitioners a mental model that helps them navigate projects that are unpredictable in nature.

## PaperCo - A Fictional Case Study

Let's get into a simple scenario - PaperCo,  is a global paper manufacturer and distributor founded in the 1960's.  The CEO and her team are deeply concerned about the declining consumption of paper - they need to reinvent their business. To overcome such a challenge, they need to strengthen the leadership bench and they need to do it fast.

The HR department at PaperCo has gotten in touch with SMtalent, a consultancy specialized in talent management and organizational development. SMtalent has helped PaperCo map out all their key positions and hash out what the future leadership skills should be. Now, PaperCo will run a series of ACDC's in partnership with GrowTerry to understand the skill gaps in their key roles, so they can improve in the future.

SMtalent has proposed a 3-day development center design, where the executives will face challenging business simulations, receive feedback and draft a development plan.

The assessor team will be formed by SMtalent external consultants, PaperCo HR representatives, and other business executives with no hierarchy ties to the participants. Keeping everything on time and tidy is a job by itself, so a small team of organizers is also there to take care of logistics and data handling.  More details about the actors involved in this ACDC can be found at the System Map section.

In the picture you can see the high-level design of a (very!) classic ACDC proposed by SMtalent.  It can fit between 8 and 12 participants and assessors.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c9af5027-f1b1-4d88-bb9e-7b930fe506dc/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c9af5027-f1b1-4d88-bb9e-7b930fe506dc/Untitled.png)

The first two days are the most demanding. Participants are subject to high-intensity exercises that aim at emulating realistic leadership scenarios.  Participants are given a large amount of time to digest a case study that will feed the context of the other simulations. Then, they receive additional instructions prior to any of the exercises.

While the content of the simulations changes quite a bit, participants always go through the same cadence. First, they prepare for exercises individually. Once their preparation time is over, they go to another room where they will perform the exercise. Here the assessors observe and evaluate the participants, but they don't share their ratings. After that, the participants take some time to self-assess their own performance. Once they are done, they are ready to enter the next exercise cycle.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b896dab6-0625-4cea-ad04-dd5b3a9a8c89/cycle.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b896dab6-0625-4cea-ad04-dd5b3a9a8c89/cycle.jpg)

The exercises feature a group discussion with other participants, two presentations and three role plays. At the end of both day 1 and 2 participants receive behavioral feedback by the assessors. Then everyone is off to dinner.

The focus of the third day is development. Participants are introduced to a personality test so they have access to additional insights outside of the simulations, and then they have a session where they are introduced to the concept of development planning. While this happens, assessors look into the participants' competency profiles, and gather the basis of the final feedback reports.

After lunch, participants have a final feedback session where observers share a summary of the feedback that was gathered during the simulations. Then it's the final closing session, and everyone can be off to a well-deserved weekend.

In the follow-up, participants get their feedback reports and schedule time with their line managers to discuss next steps under the light of their development plan.

This high level view provides some context on how a development center works. An awful lot of things can go wrong, especially if a PaperCo has never done anything similar before. Let's dive into the tools to shed some more light on what goes on under the hood.

## Using System Map

System maps are artifacts that help visualize the context of a service and its main parts as a constellation of relationships. They may include people, customers, organizations, physical systems and more.  They capture the interconnectedness of a complex system very well and help analyze both the 'as-is' and 'to-be' context of a service.

There are many different variations of a System Map. Stakeholder maps, focus mostly on  the key people involved in a service. Value network maps capture the exchanges between the actors of the service ( this could be information, documents, money, API calls or anything else ), and vary greatly in complexity. Check out the resources section if you want to know more.

The classic project management tool for mapping the people involved in a system is the 2x2 Stakeholder Management Grid. It does provide some structure, but it has some limitations. The grid does not provide insights on the relationships between stakeholders or how information might flow amongst them. When used with team sessions, I feel the tool can easily sways the thought process of a group from discussing value to discussing hierarchy and power.

System maps can add a lot of value for practitioners in ACDC and Organizational Development in General. Learning and Development programs  have multiple stakeholders, are usually nested within larger initiatives and are being rolled out across countries in parallel.  A System Map help teams accomplish important things like visualizing the cascading effects of not having the right interfaces, mapping out silos or agreeing on the scope of an intervention.

Going back to our PaperCo ACDC case,  you can find a Stakeholder Map that shows who are the most important people ( and a system ) involved in the ACDC designed by SMtalent. At the very center of the map it's our most important stakeholder ( the participant ), and in the other circles you can see stakeholders from PaperCo ( yellow ), SMtalent( blue ) and the venue where the ACDC will take place ( red ).

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8e8a8380-ab88-4e37-939b-71cf0d56d416/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8e8a8380-ab88-4e37-939b-71cf0d56d416/Untitled.png)

The lines represent the frequency/intensity of interactions between the actors ( solid line for stronger, dotted for lighter).  The number of relationships a stakeholder has gives us a sense of its importance or the complexity of the role they must play.

The **Participant** is the star of the show. Throughout the ACDC, the participant prepares simulations, performs them and receives feedback from the observers and the facilitators. The Participant is invited to the ACDC by the Talent Manager, who will then work to liaise next steps alongside the Participants'  Line Mamager and Local HR once the ACDC is finished.

**The Center Manager** is the orchestrator of the ACDC on TalentTalent's side. She acts as the single point of contact for PaperCo and consults them.  Center Manager works closely with Talent Manager across all phases of the ACDC project, and relies on the assessment data stored at Analytics Service to provide better consulting services. The Center Manager works with simulation designers to prepare simulations and assessment tools that fit the needs of PaperCo. She also keeps oversight of some of the logistics with Center Organizer. Center manager also looks for Facilitators that can deliver the ACDC and briefs them.

**The** **Talent Manager** takes care of orchestrating the ACDC on PaperCo's. She works with Global HR to understand the needs of the leadership pipeline and nominate participants. In collaboration with Center Manager, Talent Manager builds the ACDC concept. Once that is signed off, Talent Manager needs to find an internal team of observers  that participates in the ACDC, find a venue and secure hotel logistic support.

**The Facilitator** is the showrunner of the ACDC during the 3 days and has one of the most complex roles. The facilitators train the observers on how to observe, are role players during the simulations, provide feedback to participants, capture key strengths and areas of development. The facilitator is also an ambassador of the TalentTalent brand and is responsible for making sure it all goes smoothly. Facilitators and Organizers work closely to make sure it all runs on time.  Facilitators tend to be independent contractors that are hired on demand by TalentTalent - they have no client contact and must hit the ground running when called for an ACDC.

**The Organizer** is the ACDC's taskmaster. The keep coordination of a complicated schedule where multiple observers and participants need to run many things in parallel. The Organizer also collects the assessment data generated by the Observers. Organizer is fundamental in guiding the three days successfully.

System maps are also valuable because it helps us explore breakdowns of communication, process inefficiencies or mismanaged expectations that will ultimately impact the participant. Let's have a look at distant or inexistent relationships. For example:

- Participants create a development plan at the end of the ACDC. How does the Talent Manager ensure a good follow up with the line manager and how can he track the progress of her talent pool?
- How can we maximize the value of the work of the Simulation Designer? How does she really get to know the business  and leadership challenges of PaperCo?
- The Facilitator is almost "plugged in" in the delivery of the ACDC , they could be external to TalentTalent, they might not interact with Talent Manager at all - What could be done to smooth out their integration into the process?
- Talent Manager gets guidance from Global HR and tries to work with Local HR, but the relationships are not that intense - To what extent is this constellation helping Talent Manager translate a global approach to managing leadership across affiliates?

## Using Personas

Personas were originally conceived by User Researchers. They are artifacts that aim to summarize the goals, motivations, behaviors and attributes of a type of user. Personas add most value when you have large amounts of research data and you want an artifact both gives focus and contains the most representative information.

The tool has been adopted by designers, marketers, agilists, business analysts and many other professionals concerned with solving problems that require empathy and perspective-taking. This wide adoption also opens the door for [misuse](https://www.notion.so/mjimenez/Service-Design-in-Development-Centers-A-Case-Study-Draft-6e4cef40f7e743728b6f9b78a124227b#07df9d46a41341d7b70345e6a8a76a8f).

Personas can add a lot of value in the context of ACDC's. Becoming aware of participant archetypes based on research and experience can help ACDC designers create targeted DC's that truly revolve around the goals, the context and the motivation of their particants.

Back to the PaperCo case study, below you can find a couple of slightly exaggerated Participant Personas Archetypes. I produced these based on my own experience and without doing proper research. If you want to get the most out of the tool, don't do like me and spend some time talking and observing your participants.

Pam and Giorgos as diametrically opposed profiles. It is a sound assumption to say that Pam has the right frame of mind for facing the ACDC, and her goals are directed towards making the most out of the week. Giorgos is in a very different state of mind, and he is bound to have an experience that is alien and aggressive.

## Using Journey Maps

Journey Maps capture how a type of user moves through the different steps of a service or experience. There is a whole typology of Journey Maps providing different levels of information and serving slightly different goals, but they all help in surfacing gaps in a service.

One of the main challenges when designing the flow of an ACDCs  is zipping a lot of work in a couple of days. You might want a perfect 4-day ACDC, but business reality then forces you to fit those ideas in just a couple of days. Stress, pressure and tiredness magically become an unexpected benefit  ( How many times have you heard "participants should deal with a bit of stress." ?  ), but the truth is a negative experience leads to less engagement and diminished learning outcomes. To create moments of learning, you need to understand the learners context, state and goals.  Journey Maps are valuable because they capture detailed information on those variables across space and time.

Right bellow you can see mock up Participant Journeys for the first day of the PaperCo ACDC.  I captured a couple of the basics that you would typically see in User Journey Maps , I followed the ACDC flow steps, but in practice you could zoom out or zoom in just like you would do when analysing business processes.

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9d71d8a9-5e3b-4f00-945e-098b7ded1b8d/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9d71d8a9-5e3b-4f00-945e-098b7ded1b8d/Untitled.png)

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0be445a8-cc9f-47a0-84ca-b616c50a7d86/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/0be445a8-cc9f-47a0-84ca-b616c50a7d86/Untitled.png)

Giorgos' map is crowded with negative emotions. He never wanted to be in the ACDC, so it's no surprise that he is already negatively biased towards events that are draining, unfamiliar and potentially damaging to his self-concept. Pam, suffers from an acute energy drain from lunch onwards, to the point that her performance and her ability to process feedback are impacted.

## Ideation: How Might We?

Ideation in service design is the natural step after having spent enough time scoping, researching and understanding the problem. A plethora of methods for ideation are out there - I will cover one of the most popular: How Might We (HMW)

The How Might We was invented by Procter and Gamble in the 70's but has been made popular by Ideo and Google Ventures. The name says it all - The method reframes pain points into possibilities with optimistic "How might we" questions.  It might look like a trivial thing to do, but choice of words makes a massive difference in collaborative sessions. The method manages to transform negative perception into a focused and collaborative approach to idea generation.  Some examples:

Filling out the customer complaint form takes way too much time and effort

→ "How might we streamline the process of submitting a complaint?"

The number of options in the restaurant is overwhelming

→ "How might we simplify the menu? "

In the context of our PaperCo ACDC, we could reframe the following pain points into HMW questions and then ideate around them:

Participants' level of stress is heightened during preparation sessions because of peer pressure.

→ "How might we create an atmosphere where it's ok to play and experiment during preparation sessions?"

Some participants already arrive into the event with a mindset that will not help them perform, learn or engage.

→ "How might we prepare participants to welcome an event that is likely to put them outside of their comfort zone? "

The preparation needed for some exercises is too short. You might be missing on the 'real' performance of the participant if he/she had more time to prepare.

→ "How can we structure the brief needed for a simulation in a way that is easy to absorb yet provides enough context for participants?"

## Summary / TL;DR

- Research supports that Development Centers tend to take an utilitarian/organizational perspective that can hurt the performance of the participants and their learning experience. This can bring negative organizational outcomes due to dips in career motivation and engagement.
- Development Centers are more than a tool to measure competencies. They shape the expectations around leadership  and performance in an organization, and their experience strongly influences future learning and career advancement.
- Service Design ( and Human Centered Design methodologies by extension ) can help practitioners be more attentive of the goals, motivation and context of the participants as they go through the different steps of an ACDC. This awareness can help them redesign the experience considering the psychological well-being of the participants.
